    </p>

    <h2>
      1. Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy regulates the handling of information in the mobile application (hereinafter referred to as the "Application"), developed for the Android OS.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using our Application, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Since we do not collect or process your personal data, this agreement is formal in nature and informs you about the complete confidentiality of your use of the Application.
    </p>

    <h2>
      2. Information Collected
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>Important:</b> Our Application does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data of users.
    </p>

    <h3>
      2.1. Absence of Data Collection: The Application does not require registration, does not request or collect your name, email address, phone number, location data, or any other personal information.
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
      2.2. Local Data on the Device: The only information generated during the use of the Application is stored exclusively on your device and is not transmitted to us. Such data includes:
    </h3>
    <p>
      <b>Application Settings:</b> Parameters such as the choice of color for the pieces or game board are stored locally on your device using the SharedPreferences technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Game Counter:</b> A count of played games is maintained, which is also stored only on your device and can be reset at any time through the corresponding interface of the Application.
    </p>

    <h3>
      2.3. Permissions: The Application requests only one permission:
    </h3>
    <p>
      <code>android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> (Write to External Storage). This permission is used solely for the technical needs of the Application's operation and is not used to access or collect your personal files (e.g., photos or documents).
    </p>

    <h2>
      3. Use of Information
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since we do not collect any information, we do not use it for any purposes. All data described above is used exclusively within the Application to ensure its functionality (remembering your settings and game score) and never leaves your device.
    </p>

    <h2>
      4. Information Sharing
    </h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect data, which means we have nothing to transfer. We do not share any data with third parties, including advertising and analytics companies.
    </p>

    <h2>
      5. Data Security
    </h2>
    <p>
      All data (settings and score) is stored locally on your device using the standard means of the operating system. We do not use special encryption mechanisms for this data, as it is not personal or sensitive and is not subject to transmission.
    </p>

    <h2>
      6. Data Deletion
    </h2>
    <p>
      All data created by the Application is completely removed from your device when you uninstall the Application. You can also reset the game counter at any time through the Application's interface.
    </p>

    <h2>
      7. Use of the Application by Children
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our Application does not collect any data, making it completely safe for use by individuals of any age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Application can be used by children, including those under the age of 13, without any restrictions or risks to their privacy, as data collection mechanisms are absent in principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not knowingly collect personal information from children or about children.
    </p>

    <h2>
      8. Third-Party Services
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Application does not use any third-party services that collect data. This means it lacks:
    </p>
    <li>
      Advertising modules (e.g., Google AdMob).
    </li>
    <li>
      Analytics and statistics collection services (e.g., Firebase Analytics, Google Analytics).
    </li>
    <li>
      Crash reporting services.
    </li>
    <li>
      Means of remote identification of the user or device.
    </li>
